## Description

---

The goal of the website is to create a reddit/discord like format that is familiar to gamers. Users can view the site without an account. Users with accounts can create posts, comment, and message other users. Messaging and upvotes can get complex so the minimum product could be a video player with a soundcloud like scrubber showing when a user tagged their comment.

<br>

#

## User Story
A community where gamers can interact with each other in the form of comments with upvotes and downvotes, watch videos of other usersâ€™ game play and provide critiques, and post videos of their own content for feedback and advice from other users.
